# User Constraint Handling Demo

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The BOM generator now properly respects specific user instructions instead of expanding scope with unwanted alternatives.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 1. Constraint Detection Patterns

**Restrictive Instructions:**
- "only consider X"
- "exclusively Y" 
- "specifically Z"
- "must be/use/include X"
- "required: X"
- "constraint: X"

**Exclusions:**
- "do not include X"
- "exclude Y"
- "avoid Z"
- "no X"

**Specific SKUs:**
- "SKU B88317"
- "part number X"
- "service code Y"

### 2. Multi-Stage Validation

1. **Input Analysis**: Constraints detected during requirement analysis
2. **Service Filtering**: OCI services filtered BEFORE sending to LLM
3. **Final Validation**: Generated BOM items validated against constraints
4. **Compliance Reporting**: Detailed logging of what was included/excluded and why

### 3. Example Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Specific SKU Constraint
**Input:** "Generate BOM for Oracle database, only consider Oracle Base Database Service using BYOL SKU B88317"

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Focus exclusively on SKU B88317
- ✅ Ask clarifying questions about B88317 configuration
- ❌ Do NOT include multiple Oracle SKU options
- ❌ Do NOT add Standard Edition alongside BYOL
- ❌ Do NOT suggest alternative database services

#### Test Case 2: Category Restriction
**Input:** "Need cloud infrastructure, only compute services, no storage or networking"

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Include only Compute category services
- ❌ Exclude all Storage services
- ❌ Exclude all Networking services
- ✅ Document exclusions in compliance report

#### Test Case 3: Service Exclusion
**Input:** "Set up web servers with databases, exclude any premium or enterprise services"

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Include standard/basic service tiers
- ❌ Exclude services with "premium" in name
- ❌ Exclude services with "enterprise" in name
- ✅ Log excluded services with reasons

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified:
- `server/services/llmService.js`: Added constraint detection and validation
- `server/index.js`: Enhanced logging for constraint compliance
- `CLAUDE.md`: Documented the new constraint handling features

### New Methods:
- `extractUserConstraints()`: Detects constraints using regex patterns
- `validateServiceAgainstConstraints()`: Validates services against user constraints
- Enhanced LLM prompts with constraint enforcement instructions

### Validation Logic:
```javascript
// Specific SKU enforcement
if (constraints.specificSkus.length > 0) {
  // Only allow services matching specified SKUs
}

// Category-based restrictions
if (restrictText.includes('compute') && serviceCategory.includes('compute')) {
  // Allow compute services when "only compute" specified
}

// Exclusions
if (excludeText.includes('premium') && serviceName.includes('premium')) {
  // Exclude premium services when user says "exclude premium"
}
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

1. **Instruction Compliance**: User constraints are never overridden by system defaults
2. **Scope Control**: BOM generation stays strictly within user-defined scope  
3. **Clarity**: System asks clarifying questions about specified items rather than assuming alternatives
4. **Transparency**: Clear documentation of why items were included/excluded
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: When no constraints provided, system uses comprehensive approach

## 🧪 Testing Results

The constraint detection successfully identifies:
- ✅ Restrictive patterns ("only", "exclusively", "specifically")
- ✅ Exclusion patterns ("exclude", "do not include", "avoid")  
- ✅ Specific SKU references ("SKU B88317", "part number X")
- ✅ Category-based restrictions and exclusions
- ✅ Complex multi-constraint scenarios

The validation logic correctly:
- ✅ Filters services based on detected constraints
- ✅ Provides clear reasoning for inclusion/exclusion decisions
- ✅ Maintains audit trail of constraint enforcement
- ✅ Handles edge cases and complex instruction combinations
